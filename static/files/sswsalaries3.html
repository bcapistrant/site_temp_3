<p>I gathered data from 55 Assistant Professors at 10 schools of social work with similar U.S. News &amp; World Report Rankings to Smith (17). All schools are public institutions because they have searchable salary histories in the public record.</p>

<p>I also gathered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years of Experience:</strong> years since an Assistant Professor received their PhD as a measure of years of experience (<code>YearsSincePhD</code>) and the year of salary data</li>
<li><strong>Salary</strong> from 2017 or 2016</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Living Difference</strong>: A measure of difference in Cost of Living between the location of the university and Hartford, CT (the closest metropolitan area to Smith) as calculated by <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/">NerdWallet</a>
<ul>
<li>For example, cost of living is 18% higher in Hartford than Madison, WI</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Modeling Approaches</h1>
<p>I estimated a range of salaries at Smith based on a few different approaches</p>
<p><strong>Model 1.</strong> The simple average salary for these 55 Assistant Professors: $80454.69</p>
<p><strong>Model 2.</strong> The expected salary for someone based on 0,3, or 5 years of research and teaching experience since their PhD</p>
<p><strong>Model 3.</strong> The same as #2, adjusted for School Ranking (salary estimated for Smithâ€™s rank)</p>
<p><strong>Model 4.</strong> The same as #3, adjusting for Cost of Living differences between sample schools and Hartford/Northampton)</p>
