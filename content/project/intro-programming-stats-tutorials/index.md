I built 5 Shiny-based apps with the [`learnR` package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) as part of a Secondary Data Analysis course I taught during Summer 2020. 

They are:

1. [Introduction to R and Data](https://bcapistrant.shinyapps.io/1_Intro_to_R_and_Data/)
2. [Introduction to RStudio and RMarkdown](https://bcapistrant.shinyapps.io/2_Intro_to_RStudio_and_RMarkdown/)
3. [Exploratory Data Analysis & Table 1](https://bcapistrant.shinyapps.io/3_ExploratoryDataAnalysis_Table1/)
4. [Inferential Statistics w/Continuous Response Variables (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation)](https://bcapistrant.shinyapps.io/4_ContinuousDependentVariables/)
5. [Inferential Statistics w/Categorical Response Variables ($\chi^2$ & logistic regression)](https://bcapistrant.shinyapps.io/5_CategoricalDependentVariables/)
