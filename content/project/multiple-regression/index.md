I taught an intermediate statistics course called Multiple Regression that was cross-listed in the Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science (SDS) departments at Smith College. [The course site](http://sds291.netlify.app) hosts course content like slides and class activities, as well as resources for students to work with census and survey data for group projects.  As with most classes during Spring 2020, the abrupt shift to remote learning in response to COVID-19 meant many activities were cut short, especially in the second half of the course.
