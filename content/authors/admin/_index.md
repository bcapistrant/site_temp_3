I am a population health reserarcher and data scientist. Currently, I lead research at [Morgan Health](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/our-business/morgan-health). I previously was a Principal Data Scientist at [Altais](https://altais.com/), a Blue Shield of California subsidiary, and a Data Scientist at [Cityblock Health](http://www.cityblock.com), where I led evaluation and experimentation for member engagement. Prior to that, I had academic research and faculty positions at Smith College, University of Minnesota, and University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill.

In my academic research, I used large datasets and experimental studies to characterize: 1. how families provide support, including caregiving, for a family member with care needs and 2. how that support affects the caregiverâ€™s health. I built an R package to facilitate this work, making the largest data package of caregivers data (2.3 million observations). I used causal inference methods, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis methods in other studies that focus on population aging, prevalence and distribution of health conditions that drive care needs in later life.

My policy work has included building predictive models of population aging and mortality for state-level Medicaid long-term supports and services planning. I have also done program evaluation capacity building and study design technical assistance among community based organizations working toward value-based payment models for Medicaid reimbursement.
